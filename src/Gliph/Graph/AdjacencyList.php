 * Core logic for an adjacency list-based graph representation.
 *
 * Adjacency lists store vertices directly, and edges relative to the vertices
 * they connect. That means there is no overall list of edges in the graph; only
 * a list of the graph's vertices. In this implementation, that list is keyed by
 * vertex, with the value being a list of all the vertices to which that vertex
 * is adjacent - hence, "adjacency list."
 *
 * Consequently, this structure offers highly efficient access to vertices, but
 * less efficient access to edges.
 *
 * In an undirected graph, the edges are stored in both vertices' adjacency
 * lists. In a directed graph, only the out-edges are stored in each vertex's
 * adjacency list. This makes accessing in-edge information in a directed graph
 * highly inefficient.
